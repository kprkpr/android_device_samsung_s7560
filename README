How to compile (On Ubuntu 14.XX):

3. Type "repo sync" and let the ~10GB code download (Find something to do, it will be a while)
4. Navigate to the main CM directory from within terminal and type "cd device/samsung/kylessopen && ./setup-makefiles.sh && cd ../../.. && cd vendor/cm &&  ./get-prebuilts && cd ../.. && . build/envsetup.sh && brunch kylessopen"
